# PkgDecrypt-Frontend
A Gui For St4rk's PKG Extractor

Linux Version May Require libssl-dev 
(sudo apt-get install libssl-dev)

Written in python tkinter however i did use PAGE to create the GUI's easier.

For noobs: No this will NOT enable piracy, no you cannot convert pkg to psvimgtools either (yet) this might come eventurally if we get teh ability to do a scePromote on pc? and no, you can not get 3.63 games working on 3.60 please dont ask these things.
